Version: 2.1.0.0
Links to all my mods including non steam versions available at: https://github.com/jaxxa/JaxxaRimworldReleaseCollection/blob/master/README.md

As of 1.1 this now required EnhancedDevelopment Core to be installed.

Adds a Drilling Laser Targeting system that allows the creation or removal of steam vents. After research and construction, you will power the building while it conducts a subsurface scan. After the scan is complete, it can use a large amount of stored battery power to activate the laser of an orbiting satellite to drill or collapse a steam vent.
